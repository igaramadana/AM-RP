### jobfunctions.lua

This module provides functions for managing job-based logic, such as checking player roles, toggling duty status, and simulating job-related interactions.

- **makeBossRoles(role)**

  - Sets up boss-level permissions or access for the specified job role.
  - Often used to determine if a player can access job menus or perform administrative actions.
  - Used mainly for creating boss locked target tables
  - **Example:**
    ```lua
    makeBossRoles("police")
    ```

- **jobCheck(job)**

  - Simple check if the player has the specified job.
  - **Example:**

- **washHands(data)**

  - Simulates the action of washing hands, used in job scripts or medical job logic.
  - Currently only animation and a notfication

    ```

- **useToilet(data)**

- **useDoor(data)**
